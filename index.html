Traditionally the Basotho had different ways of dressing, depending on the age of an individual and or the occasion. Traditionally young girls would be dressed in a neckpiece made out of clay beads known as sefaha sa letsopa and a dress made out of clay beads known as thethana ea banana. Following the coming of age, a skirt would be made out of woven fibre or a cow skin skirt known as mose oa lekoko. Young boys would be dressed in tseha, an under garment made out of sheep skin cut in a triangular shape and tied around the body in such a way as to cover the private parts. With age this garment would be lengthened to cover more of the legs. Men also used to adorn blankets made out of animal skin. For chiefs, this blanket was made out of skins of wild cats or a leopard known as lehlosi. Other blankets worn by men included setipe and mokhahla</p>
